  * What new skills have you learned?
  	It was great to brush up on the HTML basics after almost 9 years!!
  	Its amazing how far HTML5 has come and I almost felt like its a completely different language :)
  * What has been easy?
    The mozilla developer resources are really fantastic!
    They have made looking up the original syntax so easy and also the other supporting information is fantastic!
  * What has been difficult?
    So many elements that I'm not familiar with yet! This is going to be challenging.
    Nothing else seems difficult yet.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    I took break after the quizzes and then got back to the actual project with fresh mind :)
